# Government-of-India-Data-Science-Challenge
Analyze large education datasets from government/public schools to figure out which factors most influence student performance, enrollment, dropout, or transition from primary to secondary. Based on your analysis, suggest where the government should be investing more or less, and how.

Use the government-collected datasets attached/linked below for your analysis or obtain your own dataset from another source (e.g. education non-profits, kaggle, google, web scraping public web locations, etc.)

What you will submit:

Excel file, Jupyter notebook, Matlab/R output of your analysis
Blog post or PDF with your commentary on the analysis, and recommendations for government
Suggested Education Datasets (India-specific)

UDISE district level data on student enrollment, dropout, and more
UIDSE state level data on student enrollment, dropout, and more
NCERT Education Survey data on schools, teachers, enrollments
AspiringMinds data on employability outcomes
Or obtain your own dataset from another source (e.g. education non-profits, kaggle, google, web scraping public web locations, etc.)
